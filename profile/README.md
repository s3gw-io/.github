# s3gw

s3gw is an S3-compatible service focused on small deployments. It can be
deployed in a myriad of scenarios, provided some form of storage is attached.

## A bit of background

Initially developed by the storage team at SUSE, its primary focus was running
on cloud native environments, namely in a Kubernetes environment backed by any
Persistent Volume Claim that was provided.

In late 2023, SUSE decided to abandon the s3gw project as it no longer fit their
goals.

In March 2024, a few members of the original team behind the s3gw project
decided to revive the project as a community effort, dissociated from SUSE.

## The Plan

Given the project is no longer backed by a full time team, and instead by a
small community of volunteer contributors, the scope of the s3gw project needs
to be adjusted.

We are currently in the process of assessing priorities and defining a roadmap
for the next 6 months.

The plan is thus focusing our efforts in ensuring stability and polishing the
existing s3gw service, its usage, and documentation, hoping the project can be
useful to others. We expect to devote some of our spare time to these goals over
the next 6 months.

In about 6 months from now, roughly in September 2024, we intend to assess
whether the project has gained traction, and whether a continued effort makes
sense.

We would thus encourage any user of s3gw out there to let us know they exist.
Bring with you some use-cases, and a wishlist. We would be most pleased if you
would file issues for what you would like to see in s3gw, bugs, rough edges, and
paper cuts.

Any feedback will be welcomed with enthusiasm!
